## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This challange look hard but if you code on your own, it will look harder that you think :) .(I'm just kidding)
I learned usage for flexbox and position elements.

### Continued development

I will study harder and challenge a lot.
